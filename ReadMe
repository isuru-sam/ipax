To run the programme 

Run GridSearch class with right parameters to the main method.
It will print the largest block

Design
1.Block class encapsulate properties of block
2.Color enum to define colors
3.BlockLocation is used to encapsulate x y coordinates to acces block directly from map
4.Grid class will hold all blocks with block location.Here compostion is used
5.processNeigbours in Grid class holds main logic to process neigbours and building totalIndependantSets of blocks
6.Hashcode and equals is used to find in map and find in set
7.OOP principles are implemented
8.GridSearch is the main class and you input coordinates in the form of  Map<BlockLocation, Block>
